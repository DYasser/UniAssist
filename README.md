# UniAssist DB Project
I created an application to train my database knowledge. In this app, the user can create an account, login and even change his/her information if wanted.

## Execution:
First thing to pop when you run the application will be this screen

### Login
![LoginScreen](https://github.com/DYasser/UniAssist/blob/master/src/main/images/loginscreen.png)

with this screen you have two paths, login or signup.
If you already signed up to the database, you can directly login. However, if you didn't then you should go through signing up.

### Signup
![SignupScreen](https://github.com/DYasser/UniAssist/blob/master/src/main/images/signinscreen.png)

In this screen you have basic information with precise instruction to not waste the least amount of time possible.
After signin up, you should be able to login and see this screen.

### Main menu

There are many options that I will let you explore by yourself (enough spoilers).

## Main Options:
- [Notes](https://github.com/DYasser/UniAssist/blob/master/src/main/Notes.java): In this option you can create notes, remove them, check them as 'complete' or modify them.
- [PasswordKeeper](https://github.com/DYasser/UniAssist/blob/master/src/main/PasswordKeeper.java): You are able to store the passwords you want to keep safe outside of all the website that remember all of your information.
- [TimeTable](https://github.com/DYasser/UniAssist/blob/master/src/main/TimeT.java): You can set your timetable to be able to see clearly what courses you have throughout the week, with professors' name, class name, credits and even how much weeks.
- [Exams](https://github.com/DYasser/UniAssist/blob/master/src/main/Exam.java): You are able to store the exams you passed and if you failed or not the course, specifying how much credit it is.
- [Settings](https://github.com/DYasser/UniAssist/blob/master/src/main/Settings.java): In this option you are able to reset all options stated before, change account information and even learn more about the project.

This is it, I learned some good skills by doing this project.
